Emotional pain is the situation of a mother who only talks to her father ... without words ...,sakit sa damdamin ang setwasyon ng isang ina dto gago lang ang tatay ... walang salita ...,1,"Adequacy: The translation completely fails to capture the meaning of the original sentence. The phrase ""dto gago lang ang tatay"" is nonsensical and unrelated to the concept of a mother talking to her father. The original sentence implies a complex emotional situation, while the translation introduces an offensive and irrelevant element.. Fluency: The phrase ""dto gago lang ang tatay"" is not fluent or grammatically correct. ""dto"" is likely a misspelling of ""dito"" (here), but even with that correction, the sentence structure is awkward and the word choice is inappropriate. The use of ""gago"" (fool/idiot) is highly informal and jarring.. Lexical Choice: The word choice is extremely poor. ""gago"" is a vulgar term and completely inappropriate in this context. The phrase ""dto gago lang ang tatay"" makes no sense in relation to the original sentence about emotional pain and a mother's communication with her father."
Miss Jean's laugh was so adorable.,Ang cute ng tawa ni Miss Jean,5,"Adequacy: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. ""Ang cute ng tawa ni Miss Jean"" directly translates to ""Miss Jean's laugh is so cute/adorable."". Fluency: The sentence is fluent and natural in Filipino. The word order and grammatical structure are correct and easily understood by a native speaker.. Lexical Choice: The word ""cute"" is a common loanword in Filipino and is perfectly acceptable in this context to convey ""adorable"". The use of ""ni"" to indicate possession is also correct."
Why are churches allowed after gyms and spas are banned?,Bakit simbahan pinayagan tapos gyms and spas bawal ?,3,"Adequacy: The translation captures the core meaning of the question. However, the omission of conjunctions and articles makes it sound less formal and slightly less clear. ""Bakit simbahan pinayagan tapos gyms and spas bawal?"" directly translates to ""Why church allowed then gyms and spas forbidden?"" which is understandable but not ideal.. Fluency: The sentence is grammatically incomplete and lacks natural flow. The absence of ""ay"" or ""ang"" before ""simbahan"" and ""ang"" before ""gyms and spas"" makes it sound choppy. A more fluent version would include these grammatical elements. The use of ""tapos"" is acceptable in informal speech but could be replaced with a more formal conjunction like ""kung"" or ""kapag"" for better fluency in a formal context.. Lexical Choice: The lexical choices are generally appropriate, but the sentence structure and lack of grammatical markers affect the overall impact. ""Pinayagan"" and ""bawal"" are correct translations of ""allowed"" and ""banned,"" respectively. However, the directness of the phrasing might be perceived as slightly blunt depending on the context."
I salute you sir MAR you are right to bring back decency to the people!,I salute you sir MAR tama po sinabi nio ibalik ang disente sa tao !,3,"Adequacy: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. ""I salute you sir MAR"" is directly translated. ""Tama po sinabi nio"" correctly translates ""you are right"". ""Ibalik ang disente sa tao"" translates ""bring back decency to the people"".. Fluency: The fluency is slightly awkward. ""Tama po sinabi nio"" is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stilted. The phrase ""sa tao"" (to the people) is also a bit unnatural; it would be more fluent to say ""sa mga tao"" (to the people). The missing ""ng"" after ""ibalik"" also affects the flow.. Lexical Choice: ""Disente"" is a good translation for ""decency"". However, the use of ""nio"" (formal you) is inconsistent with the informal tone of the rest of the sentence. ""Ibalik"" is a correct translation of ""bring back"". The absence of ""mga"" before ""tao"" makes it sound less natural. A better lexical choice would be ""sa mga tao""."
"Good morning, sir. I have an important message for you.","Magandang umaga, sir. May importante akong message para sayo.",4,"Adequacy: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. ""Magandang umaga"" translates to ""Good morning,"" ""sir"" remains the same, ""May importante akong message"" translates to ""I have an important message,"" and ""para sayo"" translates to ""for you."" The meaning is preserved.. Fluency: The sentence flows naturally in Filipino. The word order is correct, and the use of ""akong"" after ""importante"" is grammatically sound. The contraction of ""para sa iyo"" to ""para sayo"" is common and acceptable in spoken and informal written Filipino, contributing to the fluency.. Lexical Choice: While ""message"" is a direct borrowing from English, it's commonly used and understood in Filipino. However, a more formal or purely Filipino alternative could be ""mensahe"" or ""balita,"" depending on the context. ""Para sayo"" is acceptable but ""para sa inyo"" might be more appropriate if addressing someone with high respect. The choice of ""sayo"" makes it slightly less formal."
"To ensure the quality of the product, please follow these instructions carefully.","Para i-ensure ang quality ng product, paki-follow ang instructions nang maingat.",4,"Adequacy: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. ""Para i-ensure ang quality ng product, paki-follow ang instructions nang maingat"" directly corresponds to ""To ensure the quality of the product, please follow these instructions carefully."" The use of ""i-ensure"" is a direct borrowing, but understandable in context.. Fluency: The sentence flows naturally in Filipino. The use of ""paki-follow"" is a common and polite way to make a request. The adverb ""nang maingat"" is correctly placed and modifies the verb ""paki-follow."" The sentence structure is simple and easy to understand.. Lexical Choice: While ""i-ensure"" is understandable, a more natural Filipino word for ""ensure"" would be ""siguruhin"" or ""tiyakin."" Using ""quality"" directly is common in Filipino, especially in business contexts. ""Paki-follow"" is a good choice for ""please follow."" ""Instructions"" is also commonly used directly in Filipino. ""Nang maingat"" is a good translation for ""carefully."""
I'm looking forward to your presentation next week.,Inaasahan ko ang iyong presentasyon sa susunod na linggo.,4,"Adequacy: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. ""Inaasahan ko"" translates to ""I'm looking forward to,"" ""ang iyong presentasyon"" translates to ""your presentation,"" and ""sa susunod na linggo"" translates to ""next week."". Fluency: The sentence is grammatically correct and flows naturally in Filipino. The word order is standard and easily understood by native speakers.. Lexical Choice: While ""Inaasahan ko"" is a correct translation of ""I'm looking forward to,"" it can sound slightly formal. A more colloquial and perhaps more natural choice in some contexts might be ""Excited ako sa"" or ""Sabik akong mapanood ang"". The word ""presentasyon"" is a direct loanword and is acceptable, but depending on the context, using a more Filipino term like ""pagtatanghal"" might be more appropriate. However, ""presentasyon"" is widely understood."
"Can you tell me where the nearest train station is, please?",Maaari po bang sabihin ninyo sa akin kung nasaan ang pinakamalapit na istasyon ng tren?,4,"Adequacy: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. ""Maaari po bang sabihin ninyo sa akin kung nasaan ang pinakamalapit na istasyon ng tren?"" directly translates to ""Can you please tell me where the nearest train station is?"". All the key elements are preserved.. Fluency: The sentence flows naturally and uses grammatically correct Filipino. The use of ""po"" adds politeness, which is common in Filipino culture when addressing someone. The word order is also natural for a Filipino speaker.. Lexical Choice: While the words used are generally correct, ""ninyo"" is a formal way of saying ""you"" (plural or formal singular). In a casual setting asking for directions, ""mo"" might be more appropriate, although ""ninyo"" isn't incorrect, it makes the sentence sound slightly more formal than the original English sentence. ""Istasyon ng tren"" is a direct translation of ""train station"" and is acceptable, but some might prefer ""estasyon ng tren"" as it is more commonly used."
The company's quarterly report showed a 15% increase in revenue.,Ang quarterly report ng kumpanya ay nagpakita ng 15% na pagtaas sa kita.,4,"Adequacy: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. ""Ang quarterly report ng kumpanya ay nagpakita ng 15% na pagtaas sa kita"" directly translates to ""The company's quarterly report showed a 15% increase in revenue."" All the key information is preserved.. Fluency: The sentence flows naturally in Filipino. The word order and grammatical structure are correct and easy to understand for a native speaker. The use of ""ay nagpakita"" is a common and fluent way to express ""showed."". Lexical Choice: While the words used are generally correct, ""kita"" can sometimes refer to 'income' or 'profit' rather than just 'revenue'. Depending on the specific context, a more precise term like ""benta"" (sales) might be more appropriate. ""Pagtaas"" is a good general term for 'increase'."
You need to be responsible for the actions you take.,May pananagutan ka sa iyong mga ginagawa.,4,"Adequacy: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. ""May pananagutan ka"" translates to ""You have responsibility"" or ""You are liable,"" and ""sa iyong mga ginagawa"" means ""for your actions/doings."" The core message is preserved.. Fluency: The sentence flows naturally in Filipino. The word order and grammatical structure are correct and easy to understand for a native speaker. The use of ""iyong mga ginagawa"" is a common and natural way to express ""your actions."". Lexical Choice: While ""pananagutan"" is a correct translation of ""responsibility,"" it carries a slightly more formal or legalistic connotation than the English word in this context. A more common or conversational alternative might be ""responsibilidad"" (borrowed from Spanish/English) or a phrase emphasizing accountability. ""Ginagawa"" is a general term for ""actions"" or ""doings,"" and while accurate, it could be more specific depending on the context. A more nuanced choice might consider the intent behind the actions."
