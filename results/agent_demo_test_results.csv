""Ang mga KPIs ng proyekto ay nasa labas ng track"" is understandable, although a more natural phrasing exists. ""Kailangan natin mag-realign ng ating strategy agad-agad"" is also understandable, but ""mag-realign"" is a direct borrowing and could be improved.. Fluency: The sentence structure is somewhat awkward. ""Nasa labas ng track"" isn't the most fluent way to express ""off track."" The repetition of ""agad-agad"" makes it sound less polished..
