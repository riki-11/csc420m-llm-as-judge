Emotional pain is the situation of a mother who only talks to her father ... without words ...,sakit sa damdamin ang setwasyon ng isang ina dto gago lang ang tatay ... walang salita ...,1,"Adequacy: The translation is completely inadequate. ""dto gago lang ang tatay"" is nonsensical and doesn't relate to the original meaning of ""who only talks to her father ... without words ..."". The phrase ""dto gago lang ang tatay"" seems to be an insult and is completely out of context.. Fluency: The sentence is not fluent at all. ""dto gago lang ang tatay"" is grammatically incorrect and doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.. Lexical Choice: The lexical choice is extremely poor. ""gago"" is a vulgar term and completely inappropriate. ""dto"" is also out of place."
Miss Jean's laugh was so adorable.,Ang cute ng tawa ni Miss Jean,5,"Adequacy: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. ""Cute"" is a good translation of ""adorable"" in this context, and ""tawa ni Miss Jean"" correctly translates ""Miss Jean's laugh."". Fluency: The sentence is fluent and natural-sounding in Filipino. The word order and phrasing are typical of everyday conversation.. Lexical Choice: ""Cute"" is an appropriate and commonly used word in Filipino to describe something adorable. ""Tawa"" is the correct word for ""laugh."""
Why are churches allowed after gyms and spas are banned?,Bakit simbahan pinayagan tapos gyms and spas bawal ?,3,"Adequacy: The translation captures the core meaning of the question. However, it's missing some grammatical elements that would make it more complete. ""Simbahan pinayagan"" is understandable but lacks the proper verb conjugation. The use of ""tapos"" is acceptable but less formal than ""pagkatapos"".. Fluency: The sentence is understandable but sounds choppy and informal. The lack of proper grammatical structure (""simbahan pinayagan"" instead of ""pinayagan ang simbahan"" or ""bakit pinayagan ang simbahan"") makes it less fluent.. Lexical Choice: The word choices are generally appropriate, although ""tapos"" could be replaced with a more formal word like ""pagkatapos"". ""Gyms and spas bawal"" is direct and understandable."
I salute you sir MAR you are right to bring back decency to the people!,I salute you sir MAR tama po sinabi nio ibalik ang disente sa tao !,3,"Adequacy: The translation captures the core meaning. ""tama po sinabi nio"" is understandable but slightly awkward. ""ibalik ang disente sa tao"" is generally correct, but could be more precise. The exclamation mark is preserved.. Fluency: ""tama po sinabi nio"" sounds a bit unnatural. A more fluent phrasing would be ""tama ang sinabi ninyo"" or ""tama po ang sinabi ninyo"". The sentence structure is simple but acceptable.. Lexical Choice: ""disente"" is a reasonable translation of ""decency."" ""tao"" is a general term for ""people,"" but in this context, it works. ""Sir MAR"" is correctly retained."
"Good morning, sir. I have an important message for you.","Magandang umaga, sir. May importante akong message para sayo.",4,"Adequacy: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. ""Magandang umaga, sir"" is a correct translation of ""Good morning, sir."" ""May importante akong message para sayo"" translates to ""I have an important message for you."" However, ""sayo"" is informal.. Fluency: The sentence is generally fluent, but the use of ""sayo"" instead of ""sa inyo"" makes it slightly less formal than the original.. Lexical Choice: ""Magandang umaga"" and ""importante"" are appropriate lexical choices. However, ""sayo"" is less formal than ""sa inyo"" which would be more appropriate when addressing someone as ""sir."""
"To ensure the quality of the product, please follow these instructions carefully.","Para i-ensure ang quality ng product, paki-follow ang instructions nang maingat.",3,"Adequacy: The sentence conveys the general meaning, but the use of English words like ""i-ensure,"" ""quality,"" ""product,"" and ""instructions"" detracts from the overall adequacy. While understandable, it's not the most accurate representation in Filipino.. Fluency: The sentence is understandable but not very fluent. The Taglish (Tagalog-English mix) makes it sound unnatural. A more fluent version would use Filipino equivalents for the borrowed English words.. Lexical Choice: The lexical choice is poor due to the excessive use of English words. While these words are sometimes used in casual conversation, a formal translation should prioritize Filipino equivalents. ""Tiyakin"" instead of ""i-ensure,"" ""kalidad"" instead of ""quality,"" ""produkto"" instead of ""product,"" and ""mga tagubilin"" instead of ""instructions"" would be better choices."
I'm looking forward to your presentation next week.,Inaasahan ko ang iyong presentasyon sa susunod na linggo.,5,"Adequacy: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence.

Fluency: The sentence is grammatically correct and flows naturally in Filipino.. Lexical Choice: The words used are appropriate for the context and are commonly used in Filipino."

The company's quarterly report showed a 15% increase in revenue.,Ang quarterly report ng kumpanya ay nagpakita ng 15% na pagtaas sa kita.,5,"Adequacy: The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. ""Quarterly report"" is translated as ""quarterly report,"" ""kumpanya"" for ""company,"" ""nagpakita"" for ""showed,"" ""15% na pagtaas"" for ""15% increase,"" and ""kita"" for ""revenue."". Fluency: The sentence flows naturally and is grammatically correct in Filipino. The word order and phrasing are typical of business reports in Filipino.. Lexical Choice: The words used are appropriate for the context. ""Kita"" is the standard term for ""revenue"" in Filipino business contexts."
You need to be responsible for the actions you take.,May pananagutan ka sa iyong mga ginagawa.,4,"Adequacy: The translation conveys the core meaning of being responsible for one's actions. ""May pananagutan ka"" translates to ""You have responsibility,"" and ""sa iyong mga ginagawa"" means ""for your actions."" However, the nuance of ""need to be"" is slightly softened.. Fluency: The sentence flows naturally and is grammatically correct in Filipino. The word order and phrasing are typical of everyday conversation.. Lexical Choice: ""Pananagutan"" is a good choice for ""responsibility,"" and ""ginagawa"" works well for ""actions."" However, ""kailangan mong maging responsable"" (from the LibreTranslate output) might be a more direct and impactful way to express ""You need to be responsible."""
