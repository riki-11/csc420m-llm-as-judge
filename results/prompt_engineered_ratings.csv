Filipino Translation: Ayoko sanang pumunta sa dentista, pero kailangan kong tiisin ito para matapos na.
Adequacy: 4 - The translation captures the core meaning of not wanting to go to the dentist but needing to endure it to get it over with. ""Ayoko sanang pumunta sa dentista"" translates to ""I didn't want to go to the dentist."" ""Kailangan kong tiisin ito para matapos na"" translates to ""I need to endure it to get it over with."" The idiom ""bite the bullet"" is translated as ""tiisin ito"" (endure it), which is a reasonable, though not literal, equivalent.

Adequacy: 2 - The translation is not adequate because it literally translates ""let the cat out of the bag"" as ""nailabas ni Mark ang pusa mula sa maleta"" which means ""Mark let the cat out of the suitcase."" This misses the idiomatic meaning of revealing a secret.
Fluency: 5 - The sentence is grammatically correct and flows naturally in Filipino.

Fluency: 4 - The Filipino sentence is grammatically correct and flows naturally.
